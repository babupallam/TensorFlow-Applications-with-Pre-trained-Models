# TensorFlow Applications with Pre-trained Models

This repository showcases practical applications using TensorFlow and Python, leveraging pre-trained models. These applications span various domains, including image processing, text processing, audio processing, and more. Each application demonstrates how to utilize a pre-trained model for real-world tasks.


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a variety of tasks using TensorFlow with pre-trained models. Each script is a self-contained example of how to perform a specific task using a pre-trained model, with minimal setup required.

## Installation

To get started with these applications, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tensorflow-applications.git
   cd tensorflow-applications
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download any required models as specified in the respective script.

## Applications

### 1. Image Classification

**Model**: `MobileNetV2`  
**Description**: Classifies images into predefined categories such as animals, objects, etc.  
**Usage**: [image_classification.py](image_classification.py)
